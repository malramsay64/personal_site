One of the biggest uncertainties when travelling is the question of
how early do I need to arrive at the airport to make it through
security in time for my flight?

This 5 min PyConAU Lightning talk walks through the process of
modelling passengers arriving at the airport
and making their way through security line.
By building upon existing behavioural research
and making a few assumptions
I find the latest time you can arrive for each flight
based on the expected length of the queue at that time.
