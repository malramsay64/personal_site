I am in the middle of my second review for
the Journal of Open Source Software
(which you should definitely know about if you don't already)
which got me thinking more concretely about
what makes good software.
What makes me trust a repository I come across on GitHub or anywhere else,
and how can I use this as a reviewer to make software better.

If you have visited a repository on GitHub
you have reviewed a piece of software.
It may not have been explicit,
and you probably didn't leave any feedback,
however you made a judgement about
whether that piece of software is worth your time.
If you think about this decision,
you have probably read;
the name of the repository,
the short description,
the structure of files,
and maybe the first paragraph of the README.
In some aspects, good software is characterised by
that first glance being informative and familiar,
having easy access to the information you want.

So in some ways
