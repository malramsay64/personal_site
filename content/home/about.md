# Biography

I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney,
having returned after spending the first six months of 2017 Co-Founding the startup FluoSat,
and taking it through Telstra's Muru-D accelerator program.
In my PhD, I am studying the crystallisation and glass formation of molecular liquids,
using computer simulations coupled with data analysis techniques,
to understand the complex behaviours of these systems.
My research interests lie in the areas of
statistical mechanics, machine learning, and data visualisation,
along with a more general interest in the commercialisation of research.
I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Science,
1st Class Honours and 1st place in his cohort.
