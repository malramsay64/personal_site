I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, having
returned after spending the first six months of 2017 Co-Founding the startup FluoSat, and taking it
through Telstra's Muru-D accelerator program. In my PhD, I am studying the crystallisation and glass
formation of molecular liquids, using computer simulations coupled with data analysis techniques to
understand the complex behaviours of these systems. My general research interests lie in the areas
of statistical mechanics, machine learning, and data visualisation.
